Such examples include an automatic event logger, interception of certain actions, etc."),Object(r.b)("p",null,"With React's Context API, you deal with a pair of components speaking only to each other. This gives you nice isolation between irrelevant data. You also have the flexibility of how you may use the data with your components, i.e., you can provide the state of a parent component, and you may pass context data as props to wrapped components."),Object(r.b)("p",null,"There is a key difference in how Redux and React's Context treat data. Redux maintains the data of your whole app in a giant, stateful object. It deduces the changes of your data by running the reducer function you provide, and returns the next state that corresponds to every action dispatched. React Redux then optimizes component rendering and makes sure that each component re-renders only when the data it needs change. Context, on the other hand, does not hold any state. It is only a conduit for the data. To express changes in data you need to rely on the state of a parent component."),Object(r.b)("h4",{id:"further-information-6"},"Further information"),Object(r.b)("ul",null,Object(r.b)("li",{parentName:"ul"},Object(r.b)("a",Object(n.a)({parentName:"li"},{href:"https://daveceddia.com/context-api-vs-redux/"}),"Redux vs. The React Context API")),Object(r.b)("li",{parentName:"ul"},Object(r.b)("a",Object(n.a)({parentName:"li"},{href:"https://www.simplethread.com/cant-replace-redux-with-hooks/"}),"You Might Not Need Redux (But You Can\u2019t Replace It With Hooks)"))))}l.isMDXComponent=!0},191:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",(function(){return b})),a.d(t,"b",(function(){return d}));var n=a(0),o=a.n(n);function r(e,t,a){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:a,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=a,e}function c(e,t){var a=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var n=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(n=n.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),a.push.apply(a,n)}return a}function i(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var a=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?c(Object(a),!0).forEach((function(t){r(e,t,a[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(a)):c(Object(a)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(a,t))}))}return e}function s(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,n,o=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var a,n,o={},r=Object.keys(e);for(n=0;n<r.length;n++)a=r[n],t.indexOf(a)>=0||(o[a]=e[a]);return o}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var r=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(n=0;n<r.length;n++)a=r[n],t.indexOf(a)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,a)&&(o[a]=e[a])}return o}var p=o.a.createContext({}),l=function(e){var t=o.a.useContext(p),a=t;return e&&(a="function"==typeof e?e(t):i({},t,{},e)),a},b=function(e){var t=l(e.components);return o.a.createElement(p.Provider,{value:t},e.children)},u={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,{},t)}},m=Object(n.forwardRef)((function(e,t){var a=e.components,n=e.mdxType,r=e.originalType,c=e.parentName,p=s(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),b=l(a),m=n,d=b["".concat(c,".").concat(m)]||b[m]||u[m]||r;return a?o.a.createElement(d,i({ref:t},p,{components:a})):o.a.createElement(d,i({ref:t},p))}));function d(e,t){var a=arguments,n=t&&t.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||n){var r=a.length,c=new Array(r);c[0]=m;var i={};for(var s in t)hasOwnProperty.call(t,s)&&(i[s]=t[s]);i.originalType=e,i.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:n,c[1]=i;for(var p=2;p<r;p++)c[p]=a[p];return o.a.createElement.apply(null,c)}return o.a.createElement.apply(null,a)}m.displayName="MDXCreateElement"}}]);
